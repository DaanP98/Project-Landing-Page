# Project-Landing-Page
Final project for HTML and CSS

This is the final project for HTML and CSS. You are provided with 2 images (1 of the complete website and 1 with some details about the styling).
It's up to you to try and replicate this website as good as possible, but don't worry about details in margins etc.
You can also use your own images or images from the web, but don't forget to credit the creators! You can mention them in this README file.

Feel free to use Google in case you don't remember something, seasoned professionals like Thomas do it all the time.

Good luck!
